            <h1>Book Dragon</h1>
            <h2>Designing a book-lovers community hub</h2>
            <img src="Assets/book_dragon/Main-photo-book-dragon.png" alt="">
            <p>Book Dragon is a comprehensive library and e-reader application designed to 
                provide book recommendations, facilitate discussions, and enhance the reading experience. Unlike existing apps such as Libby, Kindle, or Goodreads, Book Dragon integrates personalized AI-driven recommendations, an in-app reading experience, and interactive forums where readers can engage with others who share their literary interests.
            </p>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>This project was created as a personal endeavor to showcase my UI/UX design skills from research to final implementation. As an avid reader, I sought to develop an app that addresses common pain points in existing library and e-reader applications. My goal was to create a platform that allows users to seamlessly discover, read, review, and discuss books in a single, intuitive interface. Additionally, I wanted to incorporate a feature that mimics real-life library lending by enabling users to share their checked-out titles with friends and family.  
            </p>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <h4>User research</h4>
            <p> 
                Understanding the target demographic was a crucial first step. Based on research, the primary users of Book Dragon are highly educated Americans aged 24 to 60, with a slight majority being female. These users value creativity, transparency, intellect, and community. Their primary goal is to quickly find high-quality book recommendations, organize their reading lists, and engage in meaningful discussions about books they love.

            <h4>
                Competition Analysis
            </h4>
            <img src="/Assets/book_dragon/competition_analysis.png" alt="">
            <p>To ensure Book Dragon offers unique value, I conducted an analysis of existing book-related apps, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apple Books </li>
                <li> Goodreads
                <li> Kindle </li>
                <li> Libby</li>
                <li> Barnes & noble nook </li>
                <li> Bookmory </li>
                <li> Book buddy Storygraph: reading tracker</li>
                <li> Fable: Books & TV </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I examined each app’s user experience, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. Notable gaps included a lack of well-integrated recommendation engines, limited social engagement, and inconsistent book-sharing capabilities
            </p>

            
            <h4>Information architecture</h4>
            <img src="/Assets/book_dragon/site_map.png" alt="">
            <p>During the wireframing phase, I prioritized user mental models by aligning the design with established digital conventions. This ensures a frictionless experience, reducing cognitive load and improving usability. I also allocated space for search analytics, which can later be leveraged for refining the recommendation algorithm and improving search functionality
            </p>
            

        

            <h3>Design</h3>

            <h4>Branding</h4>
            <p>BookDragons mission is simple: to provide a broad scope of literary works for all people, and to nurture a community of like-minded book lovers. BookDragon champions intellectual curiosity, academic freedom, and inclusivity. 
                As such, I wanted the branding to reflect this committment to openness and imagination. 
            </p>
            <img src="/Assets/book_dragon/book_dragon_colors.png" alt="">


            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
            <p>Book Dragon was designed with a range of features to enhance the reading experience. It provides access to a vast library of both public and private book collections, along with AI-driven recommendations tailored to individual reading habits. A built-in e-reader offers customization options such as adjustable fonts, font sizes, and dark mode for a personalized reading experience. Readers can seamlessly sync bookmarks, reading progress, and highlights across devices, as well as send books to Kindle or third-party reading apps. A reading tracker offers insights into reading habits, genres, and trends, while discussion forums foster community engagement and book reviews. Additionally, a lending feature allows users to share checked-out library books with others, making Book Dragon a comprehensive platform for book lovers. </p>

            <img src="/Assets/book_dragon/logo.png" alt="">
            <p>Because book readers and writers alike both value imagination and creativity, I decided to use an illustrative approach for this app design. I chose the color purple for it’s association with the fantasy genre, and because it is not a commonly used color amongst book apps. Books are also a highly physical medium, and though in general digital design has moved away from skeuomorphism, I decided to use a skeuomorphic approach for this project since according to pew research, 68& of book responders said that like the physicality of a real book.
