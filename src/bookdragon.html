    <h2>Designing a book-lovers community hub</h2>
    <p>This concept of this app came from the experience of wanting to find book recommendations. This app centers around the use 
        of AI to tailor custom recommendations for users based on style, genre preference. Users are often given frustrating parameters</p>

    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>The goal of this app is to provide streamlines, custom tailored shopping experience to users based on their reading preferences. The app updates its recommendations for the user with each subsequent book review, building user recommendations based off of genre, trope, character, and writing style preferences. It would look for key words in reviews and match them to similar reviews.  
    </p>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p> With every e-commerce app, the question "how does this app differentiate itself from others on the market?" is a key question to consider. The premiere book app today is goodreads, which is a place for leaving reviews. Early on in the design process
        With a very intense month ahead, facing a blank canvas is not an option. Making quick decisions on the visual direction is crucial to meeting the deadline, but it could only be based on something other than subjectivity. The team was concerned about the very dark vibe they had on their website. It must resonate with the enterprise market without losing the fun element of gaming. Mood boards and stylescapes are great ways to explore different visual directions; however, gathering references from other websites is the most useful for tight deadlines. We started our research with potential visual directions from top players or aspirational brands in similar verticals, cutting-edge tech, or enterprise-friendly brands.
        
        We organize these references as a collection of bookmarks on an inspiration board or inspo board for short. The bookmarks are presented as cards with elements that will help summarize their visual direction. The elements are their logo, color palette, and adjectives about the website experience..

    <h3>design</h3>
    <p>It felt off to completely escape the dark theme, but we can't overuse it. The new brand guidelines developed by the team were almost ready, and we got a sneak peek at them. Shout out to Mathew Kerber, the lead designer behind the brand refresh.

        They used dark looks for key visuals like slides, covers, and social media but transitioned to a clear and light look for the body of content pieces. The primary graphical element outlined in the guidelines used the logo mark in oversized placements cropped into the edgers and high-contrast typography for clean compositions. A marvelous execution.</p>
